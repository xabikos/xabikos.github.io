Hi, I am Charalampos Karypidis, a Greek all around .NET software developer who tries to fit other activities, except development, in his life. 
Currently I am based in Greece in the city of [Thessaloniki][thessaloniki] and I am working remotely for a New York based company called [Ordereze][ordereze].  

As I am trying to stay up to date by reading a bunch of interesting blogs I decided that I must give some of the knowledge back by writing what I believe could be useful to other developers.

### Contact me

Find me on [Twitter][Twitter] / [Github][github] / [LinkedIn][linkedIn] or just say `Hello` at
